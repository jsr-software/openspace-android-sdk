/**
 * This is the main class of the Google Maps Android API and is the entry point for all methods related to the map. You cannot 
 * instantiate an {@link OSMap} object directly, rather, you must obtain one from the {@link uk.co.ordnancesurvey.osmobilesdk.raster.app.MapView#getMap()} method on a
 * {@link .MapFragment} or {@link uk.co.ordnancesurvey.osmobilesdk.raster.app.MapView} that you have added to your application.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Similar to a android.view.View View object, an {@link OSMap} can only be read and modified from the main thread. 
 * Calling {@link OSMap} methods from another thread may result in an exception.
 * <p>
 * <b>Developer Guide</b>
 * <p>
 * To get started, read  <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/">Google Maps Developer Guide</a>
 * {@link OSMap} closely follows the Google Maps Android v2 interface, and therefore the documentation for that API 
 * is the best starting point for users of this class.
 * <p>
 * The following classes in Google Maps have no equivalent in OS Map
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>	GoogleMap.CancelableCallback
 * 	<li>	LocationSource
 * 	<li>	CameraUpdate
 * 	<li>	CameraUpdateFactory
 * 	<li>	MapsInitializer (a map can only be used as part of an activity or a fragment)
 * 	<li>	UiSettings
 *  <li>		CameraPosition.Builder
 * 	<li>	GroundOverlay
 * 	<li>	GroundOverlayOptions
 * 	<li>	LatLng is replaced by Point
 * 	<li>	LatLngBounds
 * 	<li>	LatLngBounds.Builder
 * 	<li>	Tile
 * 	<li>	TileOverlay
 * 	<li>	TileOverlayOptions
 * 	<li>	UrlTileProvider
 * 	<li>	VisibleRegion is replaced by BoundingBox
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In, the following features of Google Maps are not supported
 * <ul>
 *  <li>	z-index for overlays
 *  <li>	map types other than the a normal 2D OS map
 *  <li>	customisable animations
 *  <li>	traffic
 *  <li>	only a perpendicular view is supported 
 * 	<li>	compass
 * 	<li>	zoom controls (zoom gestures are supported, visible controls are not)
 * 	<li>	tilt/rotate
 * 	<li>	my location button
 * </ul>
